                <li>3.2 The JaldiRummy community allows those companies that publish advertisements on our webpages to
                    set or access cookies on user computers. Other companies will use cookies in accordance with their

            <h3 class="heading-text">Web Beacons (if applicable)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>• Our webpages include electronic images (known as a "pixel GIF" or a "beacon") that allow the
                    website to calculate the number of webpage users or users that have saved a certain cookie. The ways
                    in which the JaldiRummy community uses beacons include:</li>
                <li>• Beacons used within the JaldiRummy community:</li>
                <li>• The JaldiRummy community uses beacons on the website to calculate the total number of users and to
                    identify registered users using saved JaldiRummy community cookies.</li>
                <li>• We are able to provide customized webpage services when you are on non-6.cn websites by saving
                    JaldiRummy community cookies.</li>
                <li>• Web beacons are used outside of the JaldiRummy community domain</li>
                <li>• The JaldiRummy community uses website beacons to collect data for partner websites; relevant data
                    is also used for statistical purposes.</li>
                <li>• The JaldiRummy community user data recorded by website beacons are compiled and made available to
                    our partners as aggregate data for reference purposes. Aggregate data includes information such as
                    user count and usage, but does not include any personally identifiable data.</li>
                <li>• When the JaldiRummy community places website beacons to collect data for our partners, we require
                    our partners to inform users on their privacy policy page that the webpage uses website beacons.
                </li>
                <li>• NB. This option will only be recorded in your current browser and will not be recorded in your
                    user history. Therefore, to completely block the beacon, you must click on the above link on all of
                    your computers and browsers.</li>

            </ol>

            <ol>
                <li>The JaldiRummy community typically adds a beacon when sending emails in HTML format (emails
                    containing images) to count the number of opened messages.</li>
                <li>Typically, electronic images are considered to be part of the webpage and, including banner ads, can
                    all be used as beacons. Therefore, beacons can be added to all advertisements placed by the
                    JaldiRummy community.</li>
                <li>The JaldiRummy community tracks certain usage behavior. Information collected from web beacons are
                    used to understand how customers use our products, provide more accurate reports and enhance the
                    effectiveness of our marketing.</li>

                    system to ensure the security of information transfer.</li>
